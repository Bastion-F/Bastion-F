## ⚠️ Cryptanalysis Wanted

Bastion-256 is an **experimental ARX-based stream cipher** designed for
educational and research purposes.

This project **actively invites cryptanalysis**.

We welcome:
- distinguishers from random
- reduced-round attacks
- key recovery attempts
- analysis of the key schedule and diffusion
- related-key or nonce-misuse analysis

**This is NOT production cryptography.**
