# Cryptanalysis Notes & Challenges

## Threat Model
- Passive attacker
- Known-plaintext
- Chosen-plaintext (keystream exposure)
- No side-channel assumptions

## Reduced-Round Targets
The following variants are explicitly open for attack:
- Bastion-256-16
- Bastion-256-24
- Bastion-256-32

## Goals
- Any distinguisher from random
- State recovery faster than brute force
- Key recovery on reduced rounds

## Credits
Successful attacks will be credited here.
